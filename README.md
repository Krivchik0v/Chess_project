C++ Practicing

Not done yet, i will upgrade it and ill try to optimize it, keep in mind that my c++ experience is 2-3 months (at the time when i wrote it).

(I still need to make long move for pawn and en passant)

## How to play?
i tried to recreate the original move notation, so for example

To just move rook from e3 to e8 notation will look like Re3>e8

To attack some piece with rook, if piece on e8 and our rook on e3 notation will look like Re3:e8 

To just move pawn from e2 to e3 notation will look like e3, or for example, if our pawn at e6 and we playing by black, and we want to move pawn to e5, notation will look like e5

To attack some piece on f3 with pawn on e2 notation will look like e2:f3


Black pieces is lower, white pieces is upper
